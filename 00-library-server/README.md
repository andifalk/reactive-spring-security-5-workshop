# Spring Security 5 Workshop

## Initial application

This is the initial absolutely unsecured reactive web application.

This application deals with books and users.

A standard user can borrow or return borrowed books, a curator user can add or remove books
and an admin user can show, add or remove users.

Please start into the workshop with this initial application.

You find the accompanying workshop tutorial [here](https://andifalk.github.io/spring-security-5-workshop/)

If you have already read all introductory sections of the tutorial you can directly
